<b>Modules</b>

- Camcorder

The Camcorder Library is a module of the Multimedia framework of SLP. It is responsible for capturing various types of media data such as still image, audio frame, and video frame. According to its operating modes, the camcorder is able to 1) capture Still image, 2) record audio/video frame, and 3) record audio frame only. It provides many convenient functions to control itself. Users can select types of encoders, detailed specifications of video/audio data, and various effects that enhance the quality of the resulting file.
(The current release of SDK might not support all of the camcorder library functions because the camera driver in SDK does not support many APIs should be supported.)

 
- Player

The Player Library provides various functions for a multimedia application to implement playback of media contents. An application can play different formats of audio and audio/video files. The Player Library provides an interface for playing different formats by hiding the creation/construction of various streaming elements from the application, which makes application coding simpler and faster. 


- Multimedia Session

Session means timeline of multimedia resources are used.
Application developer can determine applications' session type as "shared", "exclusive" or "replace".
"Shared" type means the multimedia session is shared with other applications, if possible. The multimedia resources can be used by other applications.
"Exclusive" type means using the multimedia session exclusively. Other applications are not allowed to use multimedia resources during this time.
"Replace" type means this will make stop previous session but allows sharing session with following application.

 
- Fileinfo

The Fileinfo library provides APIs to extract media property information and meta data from media content. These values can be used to display detailed information of the media content without playing it.

 

- Sound

The Sound library provides fuctions to play audio files (uncompressed wav and mp3) with a very simple API and to control sound volume of predefined type.
Also provides functions to playback raw PCM from a memory buffer and capture raw PCM to a memory buffer.


 

- OpenAL

OpenAL is a cross-platform 3D audio API appropriate for use with gaming applications and many other types of audio applications. OpenAL in SLP only supports playback function.
For further information, see official website : http://connect.creativelabs.com/openal/default.aspx

 

- Radio

The Radio Library provides various functions for implementing radio application. It supports the radio operations for HW radio chipset. This library can be only used when HW radio chipset is exist. Radio APIs provides the functionality for playing/stopping radio, changing the frequency, scanning and changing radio sound volumes.

 
- Utility

The Utility library provides simple functions for a multimedia application to process YUV image data and to handle jpeg data. The Utility library for processing image data supports the conversion of color format from YUV to RGB, rotation of images, and resizing the width and height of the picture. The library also saves and loads the image in the Jpeg format. This library includes simple utility features which are related to multimedia.

	@brief <sub class="ref">Also see</sub> Use Cases of @ref Camcorder_UC
<h2 class="pg">Camcorder</h2>

This part describes the APIs of the Multimedia Camcorder Library. Camcorder Library is used for recording video from video/audio input devices, capturing still images from the video input device, and audio recording from the audio input device.

Camcorder states can be changed by calling the functions shown in the following figure, "State of Camcorder".
Between each state there is intermediate state, and whilst in this state, any function call which attempts to change the camcorder state will fail.
Recording state and paused state exist when the camcorder is in video-capture mode. When in audio-capture mode, CAPTURING state will be replaced with RECORDING state.

All of the functions which change the state of the camcorder are asynchronous. The function returns immediately and a successful confirmation of state change will be notified through the message callback function. If the state is changed successfully, a state message callback function will be received with the new state, if not an error message will be received.

The followings are functions to manage camcorder module.

- mm_camcorder_set_message_callback()
	- Set callback for receiving messages from camcorder. Through this callback function, camcorder sends various message including status changes, asynchronous errors, capturing, and limitations.  One thing you have to know is that message callback is working on the main loop of application.  So until releasing the main loop, message callback will not be called.

- mm_camcorder_set_video_stream_callback()
	- Set callback for user defined video stream callback function.  Users can retrieve video frame using registered callback.

- mm_camcorder_set_video_capture_callback()
	- Set callback for user defined video capture callback function.  (Image mode only)

- mm_camcorder_get_state()
	- Get the current state of camcorder.

- mm_camcorder_get_attributes()
	- Get attributes of camcorder with given attribute names. This function can get multiple attributes simultaneously. If one of attribute fails, this function will stop at that point. 'err_attr_name' let you know the name of the attribute.

- mm_camcorder_set_attributes()
	- Set attributes of camcorder with given attribute names. This function can set multiple attributes simultaneously. If one of attribute fails, this function will stop at that point.  'err_attr_name' let you know the name of the attribute.

- mm_camcorder_get_attribute_info()
	- Get detailed information of the attribute.

- mm_camcorder_init_focusing()
	- Initialize auto focusing. If auto focusing is in progressing, stop auto focusing and adjust the camera lens to initial position.

- mm_camcorder_start_focusing()
	- Start focusing.  This function return immediately. However, focusing operation will continue until it gets results. After finishing operation, you can get 'MM_MESSAGE_CAMCORDER_FOCUS_CHANGED' message.

- mm_camcorder_stop_focusing()
	- Stop focusing. This function halts focusing operation.

- int mm_camcorder_stop_focusing( MMHandleType camcorder );

 
<b>Attributes</b>

- Attribute system
	- Attribute system is an interface to operate camcorder. Depending on each attribute, camcorder behaves differently. Attribute system provides get/set functions. Setting proper attributes, a user can control camcorder as he wants (mm_camcorder_set_attributes()) Also, a user can retrieve the current status of the camcorder, calling getter function(mm_camcorder_get_attributes()). Beware, arguments of mm_camcorder_set_attributes() and mm_camcorder_get_attributes() should be finished with 'NULL'. This is a rule for the variable argument.
	- Besides its value, each Attribute also has 'type' and 'validity type'. 'type' describes variable type that the attribute can have. If you input a value that has wrong type, camcorder will not work properly or will crash. 'validity' describes array or range of values that can be set to the attribute. 'validity type' defines type of the 'validity'.
	- A user can retrieve these values using mm_camcorder_get_attribute_info().


Followings are the attributes which should be set before initialization (mm_camcorder_realize):

<h2 class="pg">Initialize Camcorder for Image capture	</h2>

- Purpose
	- Start preview for capturing image

 

The camcorder module is initialized for Image capture by using the following steps:

-# Create the camcorder handle using mm_camcorder_create().
-# Set message callback. Message callback is a handler for camcorder message. If camcorder is trying to deliever a certain signal that happens on runtime, it uses this method. For more detail information, refer "Set Message Callback"
-# Set video capture callback. Video capture callback is a handler for the captured image. This is the only method to deliever the image. (Do not use 'MMCAM_TARGET_FILENAME' for image capturing. It can't handle multishot.) For more detail information, refer "Set VideoCapture Callback"
-# Set various attributes using mm_camcorder_set_attributes(). You can set as many attributes as you want. If you don't set any attributes, it will operate with the default values. But as a minimum, you have to set 'MMCAM_DISPLAY_HANDLE'. This is the attribute to deliever display pointer or index, such as xid of x window. So if you don't set this, there is no way to display the image.
-# Allocate resources (memory, device node, etc) for camcorder handle using mm_camcorder_realize().
-# Start receiving input video stream (previewing) calling mm_camcorder_start().

 

The following is a sample code:

@code
MMHandleType hcam = 0;

struct appdata
{
	...
	int xid;
	...
};
struct appdata ad;


static gboolean initialize_image_capture()

{

      int err;

      MMCamPreset cam_info;

      char *err_attr_name = NULL;

      void * hdisplay = NULL;

      int hsize = 0;

 

      cam_info.videodev_type = MM_VIDEO_DEVICE_CAMERA0;

      err = mm_camcorder_create(&hcam, &cam_info);

 

      if (err != MM_ERROR_NONE)

      {

                  printf("Fail to call mm_camcorder_create = %x\n", err);

      hdisplay = &ad.xid;

      hsize = sizeof(ad.xid);

 

      // camcorder attribute setting

      err = mm_camcorder_set_attributes((MMHandleType)hcam, &err_attr_name,

            if (err_attr_name) {

                  free(err_attr_name);

                  err_attr_name = NULL;

                  return FALSE;

            }

      }

 

      err =  mm_camcorder_realize(hcam);

      if (err < 0)

      {

            printf("Fail to call mm_camcorder_realize  = %x\n", err);

            return FALSE;

      }

 

      // start camcorder

      }

 

      return TRUE;

}

@endcode

Basically, you can check the return value to determine whether the function succeeded. But camcorder is composed of several thread context. So you have to check error code delievered by the message callback as well. It will notify you of errors that happened in other asynchronous contexts.

Steps:
-# Initialize camcorder for image capture as explained in "Initialize Camcorder for Image capture".
-# Start capturing the still image using mm_camcorder_capture_start().  The status of the camcorder is changed to 'MM_CAMCORDER_STATE_CAPTURING' after success.
-# You can stop capturing the still image using mm_camcorder_capture_stop(). But do not call mm_camcorder_capture_stop(), just after calling mm_camcorder_capture_start(). Because captured image is retrieved asynchronously, you can call mm_camcorder_capture_stop() after receiving the 'MM_MESSAGE_CAMCORDER_CAPTURE' message.
-# Beware! Since message callback of camcorder is operated on main loop of the application, you shouldn't hold main loop when you are waiting for the message 'MM_MESSAGE_CAMCORDER_CAPTURED'.
-# Recommended implementation is
	-# Just call mm_camcorder_capture_start() and return
	-# Wait for capture callback that you registered (the callback function that you set to 'mm_camcorder_set_video_capture_callback')
	-# Wait for 'MM_MESSAGE_CAMCORDER_CAPTURED' message
	-# Then call mm_camcorder_capture_stop() in the context of the message or another idle callback.
-# Uninitialize camcorder as explained in "Uninitialize camcorder"

<h2 class="pg">User defined filename for recording file</h2>

To Save an video or audio captured file with user defined name, you have to set an attribute named 'MMCAM_TARGET_FILENAM'.

In image capture mode, there is no interface to set the name of captured file because camcorder gives you a captured buffer directly. You can create an image file with proper name in the application.

The following code snippet explains the callback function for 'MMMessageCallback':
- First argument gives the index of the message. You can handle each message with the value.
- Second argument has a parameter structure that holds useful values for application. The original parameter type is 'MMMessageParamType'.
- It has several fields for message including union structure. By checking 'union_type' field, you can determine which type of union is used. For the type of union, refer 'MMMessageUnionType' in 'mm_types.h'.
- One message type only has one specific union in anycase. Please refer following table

Figure. State of MMPlayer

 

Most of functions which change player state work as synchronous . But, mm_player_start() should be used asynchronously. Both  mm_player_pause() and mm_player_resume() should also be used asynchronously in the case of streaming data. So, application has to confirm the result through message callback function.

 

Note: "None" and "Null" state could be reached from any state by calling mm_player_destroy() and mm_player_unrealize().


The following are supported functions in the player module.
		- int mm_player_set_volume(MMHandleType player, MMPlayerVolumeType *volume)
		- int mm_player_get_volume(MMHandleType player, MMPlayerVolumeType *volume)
		- int mm_player_get_mute(MMHandleType player, int *mute)
		- int mm_player_set_mute(MMHandleType player, int mute)
		- int mm_player_set_position(MMHandleType player, MMPlayerPosFormatType format, int pos)
		- int mm_player_get_position(MMHandleType player, MMPlayerPosFormatType format, int *pos)
		- int mm_player_activate_section_repeat(MMHandleType player)
		- int mm_player_deactivate_section_repeat(MMHandleType player, int start, int end)
		- int mm_player_set_message_callback(MMHandleType player, MMMessageCallback callback, void *user_param)
		- int mm_player_set_subtitle_silent(MMHandleType player, int slient)
		- int mm_player_get_subtitle_silent(MMHandleType player, int *slient)
		- int mm_player_set_attribute(MMHandleType player, char **err_attr_name, const char *first_attribute_name, ...)
		- int mm_player_get_attribute(MMHandleType player, char **err_attr_name, const char *first_attribute_name, ...)
		- int mm_player_get_attribute_info(MMHandleType player, const char *attribute_name, MMPlayerAttrsInfo *info)

 

Application can set/get some values into player library for applying its properties using attributes.

 

The following are supported attributes list of player library.

		- Applications can create the player handle using mm_player_create().
		- And then, attributes for the player such as the url can be set through mm_player_set_attribute() .
		- Fundamentally, one url should be set to play both audio and video contents.
		- The created window id should be set to display video using the "display_overlay" attribute.
		- All messages are sent through message callback functions to the application from the player.
		- So, callback functions should be set to receive messages like error, BOS(Begin Of Stream) and EOS(End Of Stream)
		- Player is a pipelined architecture and basic pipeline is made when mm_player_realize() is called.
		- The following is a sample code to create, realize player and set the url and display id. 

@code

Role of Multimedia Session is to manage "operation policy" between multimedia applications in multi-tasking scenario

Multimedia Session provides functions to determine type of application's policy.

Application developer can define applications' session type as "shared", "exclusive" or "replace".

"Shared" type means the audio session is shared with other applications, if possible. The audio resources can be used by other applications.

"Exclusive" type means using the audio session exclusively. Other applications are not allowed to use multimedia resources during this time.

"Replace" type means this will make stop previous session but allows sharing session with following application.


The following are supported functions :

		- int mm_session_init(int sessiontype)

		- int mm_session_finish(void)

For convenience, the file module provides an additional two APIs (mm_file_get_content_attr_from_memory, mm_file_get_tag_attr_from_memory) which manipulate the source data from memory instead of the file. They act the same as normal APIs (mm_file_get_content_attr, mm_file_get_tag_attr).



For performance, the file module provides an additional two APIs (mm_file_get_stream_info, mm_file_get_content_attr_simple) which extract the audio/video track count without time consuming operations.



The following are supported functions
		- int mm_file_get_content_attr (MMHandleType *attrs, const char *filename)

		- int mm_file_get_content_attr_from_memory (MMHandleType *attrs, const void *data, unsigned int size, int format)
